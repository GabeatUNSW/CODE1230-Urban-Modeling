    <h1>URBAN TRANSFORMATION</h1>
    <p>DEFINE URBAN TRANSFORMATION: Developing city into a better place through constructing infrastructure which results in diversifying people, expanding land, creating freshwater reservoir and etc.
</p>
    <p>Land reclamation: The total area of Singapore was only 582 sq km in the 1960s, making developable land limited for a growing nation. Through government initiatives, Singapore began an aggressive campaign to acquire and reclaim land, including filling in coastal areas where Marina bay will form and the central business district (CBD). Singapore is not estimated to be 718 sq km and is expected to grow by another 100 sq km by 2030.</p>
    <p> Sylvia Schmid - “The double land use of the reservoir—a recreational spot that also serves to improve the nation’s various water concerns—contributes to the appeal of infrastructure, which, in turn, helps facilitate a more informed connection between people and nature, particularly water’s essential and multifarious role in everyday life,” 
<p>
    <p>Marina Barrage: The $3 billion project turned Marina Bay into freshwater Marina Reservoir through
keeping the salt water out and building a dam. This provides continuous water supply to the city as well as, flood control which helps them mitigate rise in sea levels and other impacts of climate change.</p>
