  	<h1>Singapore</h1>
  
  	<p>Although small, Singapore is an economic giant because of their efficient government excelling on trade and tourism, it is a model for developing nations and a hub of Southeast Asia. The city consists of Malay, Chinese, Arab, Indian, and British cultures and it it truly a unique place to visit if you’re a tourist. The island of Singapore is located in Southern Asian at approximately one degree north of the Equator and the country consists of the island of Singapore and 58 smaller islands. The capital city of Singapore covers a third of the country.</p>

		<p>The total area of Singapore was only 582 sq km in the 1960s, making developable land limited for a growing nation. Through government initiatives, Singapore began an aggressive campaign to acquire and reclaim land, including filling in coastal areas where Marina bay will form and the central business district (CBD). Singapore is not estimated to be 718 sq km and is expected to grow by another 100 sq km by 2030.</p>

		<p>The $3 billion project turned Marina Bay into freshwater Marina Reservoir through keeping the salt water out and building a dam. This provides continuous water supply to the city as well as, flood control which helps them mitigate rise in sea levels and other impacts of climate change.</p>
		<i>“The double land use of the reservoir—a recreational spot that also serves to improve the nation’s various water concerns—contributes to the appeal of infrastructure, which, in turn, helps facilitate a more informed connection between people and nature, particularly water’s essential and multifarious role in everyday life,” - Sylvia Schmid</i>
		<i>“The starting point for Singapore is that we are a city built on an island with severe resource constraints.”</i>																																																																				
																																																																						
   	<p>Superkilen is a half a mile long urban space wedging through one of the most ethnically diverse and socially challenged neighborhoods in Denmark. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>Key moves: Superkilen is a park that supports diversity. It is a world exhibition of furniture and everyday objects from all over the world, including benches, lampposts, trash cans and plants – requisites that every contemporary park should include and that the future visitors of the park have helped to select. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>Superkilen is divided into three main areas: The Red Square, The Black Market and The Green Park. While The Red Square designates the modern, urban life with café, music and sports, The Black Square is the classic square with fountain and benches. The Green Park is a park for picnics, sports and walking the dog. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>

    <p>SUPERFLEX asked local residents to nominate specific urban objects encountered in either their country of national origin or in their travels abroad, including benches, bins, trees, playgrounds, manhole covers and signage. The nominated objects were either produced as a 1:1 scale copy or purchased and transported to the Superkilen. (SUPERFLEX 2011)</p>
    <p>By bringing their own souvenirs from different countries, the residents would know different cultures as they live in local. This is one of the ways to achieve urban transformation,as it helps to diversify people through contact with unique items.</p>
