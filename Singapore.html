  	<h1>Singapore</h1>
  
  	<p>Although small, Singapore is an economic giant because of their efficient government excelling on trade and tourism. It is a model for developing nations and a hub of Southeast Asia. The city consists of Malay, Chinese, Arab, Indian, and British cultures and it it truly a unique place to visit if you’re a tourist. The island of Singapore is located in Southern Asian at approximately one degree north of the Equator and the country consists of the island of Singapore and 58 smaller islands. The capital city of Singapore covers a third of the country.</p>

	<p>The total area of Singapore was only 582 sq km in the 1960s, making developable land limited for a growing nation. Through government initiatives, Singapore began an aggressive campaign to acquire and reclaim land, including filling in coastal areas where Marina bay will form and the central business district (CBD). Singapore is now estimated to be 718 sq km and is expected to grow by another 100 sq km by 2030.</p>

																		<p>The $3 billion project turned Marina Bay into freshwater Marina Reservoir through keeping the salt water out and building a dam. This provides continuous water supply to the city as well as, flood control which helps them mitigate rise in sea levels and other impacts of climate change.</p>

<br><p><i>“The double land use of the reservoir—a recreational spot that also serves to improve the nation’s various water concerns—contributes to the appeal of infrastructure, which, in turn, helps facilitate a more informed connection between people and nature, particularly water’s essential and multifarious role in everyday life,” - Sylvia Schmid</i></p>

	<p>Control of water is essential for the city of Singapore in two ways. First, the Marina Barrage acts as a divider between the sea and the Marina Bay which creates a fresh water reservoir inside the bay that could be used as drinking water. Second, flooding can be prevented using the Marina Barrage through ejecting excess water when necessary. It is also used for multitudes of recreational activity such as boating, kayaking and dragonboating</p>
	<br>
	<p>Expansion of land creates more space for Singapore which is extremely beneficial to the country. The new land could be used for creation of housing to alleviate the high density of the city. It could also be used to create a tourist spot like the Marina Bay Sands. Although it is beneficial to the poeple and the economy of Singapore, it is bad for the environment as it disrupts the marine ecosystem since landfills modifies the marine environment</p>
	<br>
	<p>Landfill are detrimental in three ways. </p>
	<ol>
  <li>Toxins - Most landfill contrain toxic substances. These item leach into soil and groundwater and will be environmentaly hazardous for many years. </li>
  <li>Leachate - It is highly toxic and it's created when waste breaks down in landfills and water get filtered through the waste material.</li>
  <li>Greenhouse Gas - Organic material releases methane through an anaerobic process and this contains greenhouse gas that is 25 times more harmful than carbon dioxide.</li>
</ol>
