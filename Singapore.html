  	<h1>Singapore</h1>
  
  	<p>Although small, Singapore is an economic giant because of their efficient government excelling on trade and tourism, it is a model for developing nations and a hub of Southeast Asia. The city consists of Malay, Chinese, Arab, Indian, and British cultures and it it truly a unique place to visit if you’re a tourist. The island of Singapore is located in Southern Asian at approximately one degree north of the Equator and the country consists of the island of Singapore and 58 smaller islands. The capital city of Singapore covers a third of the country.</p>

	<p>The total area of Singapore was only 582 sq km in the 1960s, making developable land limited for a growing nation. Through government initiatives, Singapore began an aggressive campaign to acquire and reclaim land, including filling in coastal areas where Marina bay will form and the central business district (CBD). Singapore is not estimated to be 718 sq km and is expected to grow by another 100 sq km by 2030.</p>

	<p>The $3 billion project turned Marina Bay into freshwater Marina Reservoir through keeping the salt water out and building a dam. This provides continuous water supply to the city as well as, flood control which helps them mitigate rise in sea levels and other impacts of climate change.</p>
	<i>“The double land use of the reservoir—a recreational spot that also serves to improve the nation’s various water concerns—contributes to the appeal of infrastructure, which, in turn, helps facilitate a more informed connection between people and nature, particularly water’s essential and multifarious role in everyday life,” - Sylvia Schmid</i>
	<i>“The starting point for Singapore is that we are a city built on an island with severe resource constraints.”</i>
